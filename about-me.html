    <h1>Hello, My name is Taysia</h1>
      <div class= "paragraph">
        <p>This is my first time creating a working webpage on my own. I am currently a student in the Treehouse Tech Degree program
          However, I graduated in May 2017 with a Bachelors of Arts in Fashion Merchandising. I am passionate about helping people find clothes they feel confident in and that help them express themselves to the world.
        </p>
        <p>Another passion of mine is coding. I discovered my love for coding in October of 2018 when I wanted to figure out how I could translate my love of creating visual displays into an ecommerce setting.
          I have always loved puzzle and I do not enjoy being bored, which is why coding and web development are a perfect fit for me, with so much to learn and create I wont have to worry about doing the exact same thing day in and day out!
        </p>
        <p>My hobbies include reading, bingeing my favorite shows on Netflix and Hulu when I have time, and exploring new parks and areas of the city with my dog, Oreo</p>
        <p>I also love to volunteer, I'm in the process of finding volunteer opportunities that Oreo and I can do together but I'm often found volunteering at many of the festivals around Columbus during the summer</p>

          <img class= "imgs" src="images/oreo.jpg" alt="Oreo, Taysia's Cocker Spaniel">
          <p> This is Oreo, my 8 year old Cocker Spaniel. We met at a rescue event two years ago and have been insperable ever since!</p>
